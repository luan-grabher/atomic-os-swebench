/**
 * Auditability-without-code layer — the thesis apex.
 *
 * The point is not just "edit atomically"; it is that a NON-TECHNICAL
 * operator can audit an edit WITHOUT reading code. Every mutating op carries
 * a founder-facing block so trust is granted at the smallest honest point.
 *
 * Hard honesty rule (this is what kills fachada): a code-edit tool can prove
 * STRUCTURE (grammar/balance didn't regress) and SCOPE (which exact bytes,
 * which single file). It CANNOT prove product behavior — only running the
 * product can. So zeroCodeTrust is CEILINGED here and the ceiling reason is
 * stated. The tool never claims "behavior proven". Claiming it would be the
 * exact fake-completion the operator's own rules forbid.
