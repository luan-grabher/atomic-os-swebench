/**
 * gates/lsp-semantic-gate.ts — DELTA semantic gate via the LSP mesh (DYNAMIC_GATES).
 *
 * This is the genuine delivery of the LSP mesh into the edit path. The standalone
 * `lsp-diagnostic-gate` is ABSOLUTE (reds on ANY error in the file, even pre-existing
 * ones), which is why it was never wired into the lattice — an absolute gate on the
 * write path would block edits to any file that already has an unrelated error. This
 * gate fixes that: it is DELTA, exactly like `type-soundness-gate` — it queries the
 * language server for BOTH the prior bytes and the candidate overlay and reds ONLY on
 * a diagnostic the edit INTRODUCES. It closes the one capability gap tsc-based
 * type-soundness cannot: cross-language semantic errors (python/go/rust/…) reported by
 * a real language server.
 *
 * Doctrine compliance:
 *   - DELTA, not absolute. Pre-existing errors appear in BOTH the before and after
 *     query and cancel; only the net-new error survives. This is `validate()`'s
 *     `after <= before` philosophy lifted to live LSP diagnostics.
 *   - HONEST / UNJUDGED, never red-by-guess. No configured LSP for the extension, no
 *     resolvable language server, the router missing, or either query failing → the
 *     gate ABSTAINS (`unjudged`) — never red, never green-by-assumption. On a bare
 *     clone / CI with no server installed it is a clean no-op, so it cannot destabilise
 *     the standalone lattice.
 *   - CONSERVATIVE. A single `didOpen` judges one file in isolation, so cross-file
 *     resolution diagnostics (cannot-find-module / undefined-name / no-exported-member)
 *     are unreliable and are EXCLUDED — the connection/binding/reachability gates own
 *     those. What remains is intrinsic single-file semantics (type mismatches, bad
 *     argument counts, arithmetic on non-numbers) that an LSP judges reliably in
 *     isolation and that an edit genuinely introduces.
 *
 * Cost: when a server IS present it spawns it twice (~before+after); bounded to a few
 * files per run. When absent it costs one cheap probe and abstains.
