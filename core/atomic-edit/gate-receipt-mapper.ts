/**
 * gate-receipt-mapper.ts — the GATE-SOURCED TRUTH bridge.
 *
 * Today server-tools-h.ts imports ONLY from server-helpers-product-locks: it has
 * ZERO contact with any real gate. So the REAL/runtime_probe tier of a truth_receipt
 * was 100% HAND-SUPPLIED — an agent could attach a FABRICATED runtime_probe evidence
 * item and mint a REAL/100 receipt with no running system behind it. That is exactly
 * the facade the receipt exists to forbid.
 *
 * This module closes that hole by making the REAL tier of a receipt UNFORGEABLE: a
 * runtime_probe evidence item is only honoured if it carries a `gateRunId` that this
 * module MINTED from an actual `runGates(DYNAMIC_GATES, …)` execution. The id is a
 * 256-bit random token recorded ONLY here, in-process, the moment a real gate run
 * settled GREEN. A receipt can no longer claim REAL on a probe it did not run.
 *
 *   runProveDirective()  → writes the directive into a THROWAWAY probe file via the
 *                          SAME atomicWrite byte-floor every tool funnels through,
 *                          runs the DYNAMIC gate set against it, reverts byte-exact
 *                          (the throwaway file is removed — it had no prior bytes),
 *                          and on GREEN mints a GateRunRecord + a fresh gateRunId.
 *   verifyGateRun()      → the receipt's gate: returns the record for a gateRunId, or
 *                          null when the id was never minted by a real run (fabricated
 *                          / replayed-after-restart / from a non-green run).
 *
 * MUTATION FIREWALL: the only write this module performs is the throwaway probe file,
 * through atomicWrite (snapshot/validate/trace), and it is deleted in a finally. The
 * repo source tree is never touched. A gate that throws is honest-unjudged, never a
 * false green — the receipt only accepts a run that was GREEN with ≥1 gate that
 * actually RAN (a gate set that judged nothing is NOT a proof of liveness).
