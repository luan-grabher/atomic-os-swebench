/**
 * engine-proof-reexec.ts — the Proof-Carrying Edit RE-EXECUTION + Merkle + seal core.
 *
 * Thesis (GAP #1, Daniel): a proof-carrying edit must be verifiable by RE-RUNNING
 * the construction, not merely by re-hashing a number the producer also wrote. A
 * hash recompute proves only "these three bytes hash to that"; it does NOT prove the
 * recorded gate verdict is the verdict the engine would actually reach over the real
 * before/after content. The strong claim — "this edit is correct-by-construction and
 * you do not have to trust me" — requires four independent, producer-untrusted checks:
 *
 *   (1) RE-EXEC      — re-run engine.validate(file, before, after) over the EMBEDDED
 *                       snapshot content and assert the recorded validation verdict
 *                       (language / before-count / after-count / ok) REPRODUCES. The
 *                       verifier reconstructs the syntactic judgment from first
 *                       principles; a forged "ok:true" over content that actually
 *                       regresses no longer reproduces.
 *   (2) MERKLE       — a Merkle root over the session's op afterSha256 leaves, with
 *                       the op's leaf + inclusion path embedded in the artifact, so a
 *                       single op is provably a member of the snapshotted session
 *                       state without shipping the whole chain.
 *   (3) gateRunId    — a dedicated cryptographic identifier per gated op, derived from
 *                       the bound (verdict ‖ after ‖ parent) so two distinct gate runs
 *                       can never collide and a verdict cannot be re-attributed.
 *   (4) SEAL         — an HMAC seal over the canonical final-state body (root ‖ leaf ‖
 *                       gateRunId ‖ chainHash ‖ reexec assertion), checked by the
 *                       verifier. The seal binds the WHOLE proof into one tamper-evident
 *                       unit: edit any embedded field and the seal no longer recomputes.
 *
 * Plus (5) the full per-gate DECISION TREE — each gate name + ran/red/unjudged + fact —
 * extracted from the RegistryRun so the artifact carries the gate-by-gate reasoning,
 * not just the green/red summary.
 *
 * Pure + side-effect-free: every function here takes content/verdicts as arguments and
 * returns data. No file I/O, no process concerns — the .mjs CLI imports the COMPILED
 * dist/ form and drives I/O itself (matches the engine ↔ server split). Self-verifying:
 * the same functions the producer uses to BUILD the proof are the ones the verifier uses
 * to CHECK it, so there is no second, drift-prone re-implementation to keep honest.
